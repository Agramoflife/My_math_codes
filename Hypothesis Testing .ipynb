    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to test a claim or hypothesis about a parameter in a population, using data measured in a sample¹. This parameter could be the mean, standard deviation, proportion, or any other numerical characteristic of the population¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: This is a statement about the population parameter that is assumed to be true unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary⁴. For example, if we believe that the average weight of a certain species of bird is 2kg, then our null hypothesis would be \"The average weight of the bird species is 2kg\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: This is a statement about the population parameter that contradicts the null hypothesis⁴. It's accepted as true only if there's convincing evidence in favor of it⁴. In our bird example, an alternative hypothesis could be \"The average weight of the bird species is not 2kg\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test Statistic**: This is a value computed from the sample data that's used in making a decision about the rejection of the null hypothesis³. It converts the sample mean or sample proportion to a Z- or t-score under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true³.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **P-value and Level of Significance**: The p-value measures the strength of evidence in support of a null hypothesis. The level of significance (commonly set at 0.05) is a threshold used to determine when we reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than or equal to the level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, hypothesis testing allows us to make an educated guess about an assumption using statistics. It helps us understand how true our assumption might be for the entire population from where our sample data was taken⁶."

If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score⁶. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean⁶. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean⁶.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Z-transformation**: Z-transformation, also known as standardization, is a process of converting a set of raw scores to a set of standardized scores that have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one¹. This process involves calculating the Z-score for each data point in your dataset. The resulting dataset is said to have been \"standardized\" or \"Z-transformed\". This transformation is useful for comparing scores from different distributions or computing probabilities associated with normal distributions¹.\n",
