    "A confidence interval is a statistical range that estimates the true value of a population parameter, such as a population mean or proportion. It's a way to express the uncertainty associated with the estimation and is often used in inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, when you collect a sample from a larger population, you might want to estimate a population parameter, like the average height of people in a country or the proportion of voters who support a certain candidate. A point estimate (like the sample mean or sample proportion) gives you a single value, but it doesn't account for the variability that might exist if you were to take multiple samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie. For instance, a 95% confidence interval for the average height of people in a country might be 160cm to 170cm. This means that if you were to take many samples and compute the confidence interval for each, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true average height of the entire population.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The width of the confidence interval is affected by factors like the sample size, the variability in the data, and the chosen level of confidence (such as 90%, 95%, or 99%). A higher confidence level will result in a wider interval, reflecting greater certainty that the true parameter lies within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that a confidence interval doesn't provide the exact value of the population parameter but rather a range of plausible values based on the sample data and the level of confidence chosen."

    "In other words, 95% of the intervals would capture the true population parameter. It's important to note that this doesn't mean that there's a 95% probability that any one interval captures the true population parameter. The interval either captures it or it doesn't. \n",
